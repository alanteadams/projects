[Verse 1]
I seen 'em and still couldn’t believe 'em
That shit broke my heart into pieces
How you turn your back on your people?
When you know them people, they need you
I have a big dawg, I had a big brother
And all of my niggas, we equal
I been with the same niggas, them my day ones
Way before the sequel
I told the lil' bitch to be cautious
But she got addicted and didn’t need a needle
It seem like the image just come with success
'Cause a nigga been hot as a fever
I'm kickin' big shit, not no FIFA
Gotta keep a bald bitch like Rashida
No, I'm not needy, so no, I don't need her
I just need the plug with low numbers on reefer

[Chorus]
I done seen it all
Some shit I ain't supposed to see
I watched some niggas switch up on the come-up
That ain't who they supposed to be
That shit there was cold to me
Them niggas some hoes to me
That shit done made me sit back and observe
Who really gon’ go for me?
Who really gon’ go for me?
Who really gon' go for me?
Who really gon’ go for me?
Who really gon' go for me?
Who really gon' go for me?
Nigga fake and they close to me
Ain't the nigga that they supposed to be
I wanna see who gon’ go for me, yeah, yeah
