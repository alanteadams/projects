I'm on that real nigga shit no I won't never change
And I don't fuck with these rappers cus these niggas strange
Shit I'd rather be a trapper give a fuck bout fame
You run up thanking you a jacker you can loose ya brain
(Baah!)
And I'ma say this once watch how you say my name
And I can't trust nomo that shit so fucking lame
I could've bought me a new house but I copped me a chain
And I jus left Ice Man this ain't from Johnny Dang
They say they want pressure that's what I'ma brang
Pussy nigga you can play and get hit with the flame
We go pull up where you stay and we gone
Let it rain
Nigga fuck you and your brother and fuck wat you claim
I need me a cup of ice so I pull up right at the store
I feel like future dirty sprite this shit here got me moving slow
Tryna pour a four I fucked round spilt that shit all my clothes
But what you better know is I can't move unless I got the pole
Fuck 12 they on my dick they just want me to fold
Was mad as hell I went to jail on the way to my show
They took eleven bands and then they put my shit on froze
And then they took my rifle that came with a telescope
But I'm still with the shits just thought that I should let you know
Bitch I'm that nigga that's some shit that they already know
I face the fact that I can't even fucking trust no more
Better watch your back because when you turn around they cut your throat
They cut your throat

Better watch your back cause when you turn around they cut your throat oh yeah
Inside I'm hurting but never let it show oh yeah
And this might be the realest shit I ever wrote oh yeah
Might be the realest shit I ever wrote

Better watch your back cause when you turn around they cut your throat oh yeah
Inside I'm hurting but never let it show oh yeah
And this might be the realest shit I ever wrote oh yeah
Might be the realest shit I ever wrote

Remember we was posted up at the store
Now I'm touring riding foreign every day on the road
Some of my Niggas from the Nawf
Most of my Niggas throw foes
If I ain't got it then you know my niggas clutching a pole
Don't understand why the fuck they speak on shit they don't know
I keep the stick it's in my reach and that's where ever I go
Thank I won't squeeze 'em watch you bleed
Gone loose ya top when I blow
A hunned shots gone clear the scene gone turn that bitch to a ghost
My brother been on the run the feds tryna snatch him
My plug been tryna front I guess it's time to jack him
Forever thuggin if you love me go and buy my album
But I'ma a street nigga don't give two fucks bout going platinum
(Uuuhh)

Better watch yo back cause when you turn around they cut your throat oh yeah
Inside I'm hurting but never let it show oh yeah
And this might be the realest shit I ever wrote oh yeah
Might be the realest shit I ever wrote

Better watch yo back cause when you turn around they cut your throat oh yeah
Inside I'm hurting but never let it show oh yeah
And this might be the realest shit I ever wrote oh yeah
Might be the realest shit I ever wrote
