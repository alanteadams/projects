Try to write some variables that convert the inches and pounds to centimeters and kilograms. Do not just type in the measurements. Work out the math in python.

inch = 2.54
pound = 0.45

print(f"How many centimeters are in a pound? {inch}")
print(f"How many centimeters are 100 pounds? {inch * 100}")
print(f"How many kilometers are in a a pound? {pound}")
print(f"How many kilometers are  in 1000 pounds? {pound * 1000}")
